## **Design**

### Database Schema

Based on the user stories and goals above, the following schema was mapped out:

![Database Schema](docs/screenshots/database-schema.jpg)

### Layout
An initial rough layout of the site was then devised, as shown in the following information architecture diagram:

![Information Architecture](docs/screenshots/information-architecture.jpg)

### Wireframes
*Initial wireframes for each of these pages can be found [here](docs/wireframes).*

### Color Scheme
The following color pallette was chosen for the site:

![Color Pallette](docs/screenshots/color-pallette.png)

These colors were chosen to tie in with the nature imagery displayed in the hero image (shown above). Muted colors are used to preserve the desired aesthetic while also ensuring the styling does not draw away the attention of the user from the site's content. 

In terms of accessiblity, the site's text is predominantly in a shade of black (#1C1A1A) against an off-white background (#FAFAFA). This gives a contrast ratio of 16.59:1 per [WebAIM](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/), well above the minimum needed to meet [WCAG AAA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG2AAA-Conformance) standards.
